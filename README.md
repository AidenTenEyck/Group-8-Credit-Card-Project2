The goal of this project is to create a algorithm using the diabetes prediction dataset that can narrow down people who are at high risk for diabetes.
The dataset used has 100,000 rows and 9 columns.
The data included mentions whether the person has smoked, has heart disease, bmi, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, hypertension, and if they have diabetes.
We used five classifiers  to analyze the data and train the model such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and KNeighborsClassifier.
The model is more than 85% accurate using any of the above classifiers.

This algorithm could be used as early warning system in a hospital to quickly narrow down patients who are high risk for diabetes, or alternatively it could be used by medication companies by helping them narrow down their target audience to increase the effictiveness of advertisements for their products.
